# Extension Name

A simple VSCode extension that sends a file or folder path to the "Find in Files" input field.

## Features
Adds a custom right-click command "Find in File":
- When right-clicking any file in the explorer window, an open file's title, or anything within the active file, it sends the selected file path to the "Find in Files" input box.
- Replaces Ctrl+Shift+F so that it searches within the current workspace folder, instead of the entire workspace.

## Requirements

- VSCode version: **1.0.0** or higher.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the extension folder in VSCode.
3. Press `F5` to start the extension in a new VSCode window.
4. Right-click any file or folder in the Explorer panel to use the "Send to Find in Files" command.

## How to Use

1. In the Explorer view, right-click on a file or folder.
2. Select **Send to Find in Files** from the context menu.
3. The file or folder path will be inserted into the "Find in Files" input field.
